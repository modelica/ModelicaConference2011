The 8th International Modelica Conference will be held at the Auditorium Centre of the Technische Universität Dresden, Germany on March 20th - 22nd, 2011 organized by the Modelica Association and the Fraunhofer IIS EAS.

As in recent years it will bring together Modelica users, library developers, tool vendors and language designers. The program will cover modeling of complex physical systems with Modelica in a wide range of research and industrial applications, peer-reviewed and selected by the Program Committee. In addition to traditional paper presentations and poster sessions you have the choice of several Modelica tutorials for beginners and advanced users.

We are looking forward to seeing you in Dresden and to sharing a successful and enjoyable conference with you.

_Dr. Christoph Clauß_
